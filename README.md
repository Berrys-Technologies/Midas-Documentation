Midas is a system that is fitted to the above or below ground filling points on each bulk fuel storage tank at petrol filling stations. The unit comprises of a valve with intelligent control that can discriminate between petrol and diesel grades of fuel. The purpose of the unit is to stop the wrong product entering the tank and causing a misfuel / crossover.

​

The device will be calibrated during installation for either Diesel or Petrol products, the system will then instantly read the fuel that’s being delivered and if correct open the valve to allow the filling operation to continue. If an incorrect fuel type is detected the valve will stay closed and the unit will alarm both audibly and visually to alert the driver to the mistake.
